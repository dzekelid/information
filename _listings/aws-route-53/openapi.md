      summary: Associate V P C With Hosted Zone
      description: Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone. ImportantTo
        perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already
        exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.Send
        a POST request to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone/hosted zone ID/associatevpc resource.
        The request body must include a document with an AssociateVPCWithHostedZoneRequest
        element. The response contains a ChangeInfo data type that you can use to
        track the progress of the request. NoteIf you want to associate a VPC that
        was created by using one AWS account with a private hosted zone that was created
        by using a different account, the AWS account that created the private hosted
        zone must first submit a CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization request. Then the
        account that created the VPC must submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request.
